# Shopee-Price-Match-Guarantee
The project aims to build a model that can predict which images represent the same product using a dataset available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/data. A three-five layered CNN model will be used. We will be using EfficientNet-B0 as the baseline model.
